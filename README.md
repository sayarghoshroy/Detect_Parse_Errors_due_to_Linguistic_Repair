# Detecting Errors in Parsing of Speech Transcript primarily due to Active Linguistic Repair

### [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayarghoshroy/Detect_Parse_Errors_due_to_Linguistic_Repair/blob/master/Detect_Parse_Errors_due_to_Repair.ipynb)

## Analyze Transcript of NPTEL Lectures

- Standard English Language tokenized text separated into sentences by newlines
- Six text files used for analysis: Course 101101058, Lectures 14 to 19
- Detect errors in Dependency Parse output by Spacy's parser
- Capture Instances of Active Linguistic Repair
- Find cases where Repair leads to a failed Parse

### Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for a proper understanding of the Implementation

### Refer to the full report for:
- Task Definition
